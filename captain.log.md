# IPFS Cluster - Captain's log

## 20170123 | @hsanjuan

I have just merged the initial cluster version into master. There are many rough edges to address, and significant changes to namings/APIs will happen during the next few days and weeks.

The rest of the quarter will be focused on 4 main issues:

* Simplify the process of adding and removing members of a cluster
* Implement a replication-factor-based pinning strategy
* Generate real end to end tests
* Make ipfs-cluster stable

These endaevours will be reflected on the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) file.
